# Global Health Research {#ghr}

**Global health** is the study and practice of "improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide" [@koplan:2009]. The determinants of ill health and inequality are complex, so the search for solutions often spans multiple disciplines. In the study of malaria, for example, you can read about the spread of the disease (epidemiology), the impact of illness on future productivity (economics), the merits of free or subsidized bed nets (public policy), mosquito habitats (ecology), the efficacy of vaccines to prevent the disease (medicine and statistics), rapid diagnostic tests (biomedical engineering), and the adoption and use of bed nets (psychology), just to name a few areas of inquiry.

Therefore, we say that global health research is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary [@merson:2011]. It is **multidisciplinary** in the sense that no one field can solve the great global health challenges of our time, and **interdisciplinary** because collaboration is core to progress. Let's survey the landscape of global health research before establishing some fundamentals about scientific research.

## Who Funds Global Health Research?

```{marginfigure}
The precise amount spent on global health research and development (R&D) is not clear [@schaferhoff:2015].
```

Billions of dollars are spent on global health research every year. This funding comes from public institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States and private philanthropy organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

```{marginfigure}
The [World RePort database](https://worldreport.nih.gov/app/) from the NIH—the [largest funder of health research in the world](http://www.healthresearchfunders.org/health-research-funding-organizations/)—lists health research projects totaling nearly $45 billion in 2015. It's possible to filter on the country of the recipient organization, but this does not count money disbursed to US and European organizations working on global health issues.
```

In 2015, the international community disbursed $36.4 billion in development assistance for health, down from a peak of $38 billion in 2013 [@ihme:2016]. Although Figure \@ref(fig:funding) does not present total research dollars contributed, per se, it does show the sources of global health financing, the channels through which they flow, and the areas on which they focus (see [here](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/fgh/) for an interactive version).

knitr::include_graphics("images/ihmefunding.png", dpi = NA)
```

The United States Government contributed one-third of all development assistance for health in 2015 ($13 billion). More than half of USG funding was directed to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. Noncommunicable diseases received <1% of resources, despite accounting for 7 of the 10 leading causes of death globally (Figure \@ref(fig:cod)).

```

## Who Produces Global Health Research?

Academic centers around the world, like the [Duke Global Health Institute](https://globalhealth.duke.edu/), are major contributors to global health research. Public and private donors like the USG, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Bank make grants to university-affiliated faculty members who partner with colleagues inside and outside governments to plan and conduct research. Donors also channel research support to nonprofit research organizations such as [FHI 360](https://www.fhi360.org/) and [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/), who work in a similar fashion. 

Interesting hybrid models include the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). [JPAL](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/) is a global network of university-affiliated professors from more than 50 universities that use randomized evaluations (i.e., experiments) to answer policy questions related to poverty alleviation. The JPAL website contains excellent resources regarding the methods used in randomized evaluations, as well as links to published studies and policy briefs. [IPA](http://www.poverty-action.org/) is a sister organization that is also a leader in the use of randomized evaluations to study important policy questions about global poverty.

## Where is Global Health Research Published?

Global health research is published in medical journals (e.g., [*The Lancet*](http://www.thelancet.com/) and [*JAMA*](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama)), general science journals (e.g., [*Science*](http://science.sciencemag.org/) and [*PLOS ONE*](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/)), discipline-specific journals (e.g., [*The Journal of Immunology*](http://www.jimmunol.org/content/198/1/184.short) and [*Epidemiology*](http://journals.lww.com/epidem/pages/default.aspx)), and disease-specific journals (e.g., [*AIDS*](http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Pages/default.aspx) and [*Malaria Journal*](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/)). Journals specializing in global health include [*The Lancet Global Health*](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/latestcontent), [*BMJ Global Health*](http://gh.bmj.com/), [*Global Public Health*](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rgph20/current), and [*Global Health: Science and Practice*](http://www.ghspjournal.org/).

## What is Research?

The **Common Rule** is a US federal policy that governs research with human subjects ([Title 45, Subtitle A, Subchapter A, Part 46.102](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&pitd=20180719&n=pt45.1.46&r=PART&ty=HTML)). This rule defines "research" as:

> a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to *generalizable knowledge*  

## What Constitutes Global Health Research?

Global health research brings together scholars and practitioners from many different disciplines to tackle big challenges. Therefore, the methods of these disciplines *are* the methods of global health research. We can organize the landscape as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:basicapplied). 

```{r basicapplied, fig.cap="A research taxonomy", echo=F, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/basicapplied.png", dpi = NA)
```

Research is divided into two main categories: basic and applied. Overlapping with applied research is an area of work called "monitoring and evaluation", or M&E. Let's examine what constitutes research before turning to M&E.

### BASIC RESEARCH

**Basic research**—also known as "pure" or "blue skies" research—is the pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena. For example, scientists conduct laboratory experiments to understand the parasitic life cycle and how parasites interact with humans at different stages. Another example is the scientific investigation of the properties of cancer cells to better understand how they grow and spread. 

The information generated by basic science becomes the basis for applied science. It's the "bench" in the "bench to bedside" cascade of research needed to take an idea from the lab (*the bench*) to a new medical treatment (*delivered to the patient's bedside*). 

Harvard Medical School's Rachel Wilson explains this beautifully:

> The new therapies of today were the prototypes of yesterday. And the prototypes of yesterday were previously just findings in laboratories, and before that they were just an idea. Unless we have new ideas, we're not going to have useful therapies. Great new therapies don't just fall like apples from a tree.

### APPLIED RESEARCH

**Applied research** focuses on specific problems or real-world applications. Whereas the basic scientist might toil away in the lab to understand how cellular enzymes function without a specific clinical application in mind—discovering this function is the end goal for this scientist—the applied researcher will take this knowledge of enzymes to develop new therapies that could treat cancer.

In the world of malaria research, an applied research question might be, "How can we increase the coverage and use of bed nets that prevent malaria transmission?" The basic science, such as the behavioral habits of the mosquito and the transmission conditions for malaria, have already been characterized by entomologists and epidemiologists. 

#### Clinical Research{-}

Applied science takes many different forms, including [**clinical research**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research). Clinical research is a broad field that encompasses patient-oriented research, epidemiological and behavioral studies, outcomes research, and health services research. Basic research provides the foundation for all clinical research.

One type of clinical research is a clinical trial. Drugs and vaccines have to pass through different phases of clinical trials before regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will approve their use with humans:

```{marginfigure}
Behavioral research (e.g., development and evaluation of parenting interventions) does not follow the same exact phases of vaccine and drug development, but the broad principles are the same.

  "When using this optimal dose, is there any effect of the drug on clinical markers or health outcomes?",
  "What is the effect of the drug on clinical markers or health outcomes when compared to an existing treatment or placebo in a randomized evaluation? Success at this stage is required for regulatory approval in some countries.",

##### Case study: Developing a malaria vaccine {-}

The development of a vaccine for malaria provides a good example of the life cycle of a clinical trial. In 2015, after 30 years of research, a vaccine candidate called RTS,S, or Mosquirix™, [made the news](http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/news/malaria-vaccine-bill-gates/) for having gotten one step closer to becoming a licensed vaccine after a successful Phase III trial. 

[Development of RTS,S](http://malariavaccine.org/files/UpdatedRTSS_FactSheet_21April2010.pdf) began in 1984 through a partnership between the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. In 1987, a promising vaccine candidate entered **preclinical** research. During the preclinical phase, researchers performed tests on nonhuman subjects to collect data on how well the vaccine worked (**efficacy**), how much damage it could do to an organism (**toxicity**), and how the body affected the vaccine (**pharmacokinetics**).

```{marginfigure}
If you compare the sample sizes of the Mosquirix™ trials, you'll see that they do not follow the rules of thumb noted in the table above. These types of deviations are common in research. The goals of these particular trials demanded larger sample sizes than is typical.
```

Clinical research on humans began in 1992. To obtain regulatory approval, the vaccine had to complete three phases of testing. Doherty et al. [-@doherty:1999] conducted a **Phase I** safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. This small sample size is typical of Phase I trials, where the main objectives are usually to determine a safe dosing range and to evaluate side effects. These researchers reported that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies. 

Several **Phase II** studies conducted over the following decade (Phase IIa and Phase IIb) demonstrated the **efficacy** of the vaccine against several end points (or outcomes) [@moorthy:2009]. A Phase IIb trial began in Mozambique in 2003 with more than 2,000 children aged 1 to 4 years [@alonso:2004]. Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. A follow-up study with 214 infants also showed partial protection from malaria [@aponte:2007]. This Phase II trial was an important proof-of-concept study.

The final results of a large **Phase III** trial with more than 15,000 infants and young children in 7 African countries were published in *The Lancet* in 2015 [@rts:2015]. Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (a) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (b) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (c) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3--4-year period. This Phase III trial achieved its goal—to show that the treatment was efficacious.

On the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a "European scientific opinion" to help inform the decision of the WHO and African national regulatory authorities regarding their recommendation of the vaccine. If RTS,S is approved for use and eventually hits the market, researchers will likely conduct **Phase IV** trials to evaluate the vaccine's long-term effects.

#### Implementation Research and Translational Research{-}

```{marginfigure}
Implementation *research* is a subset of implementation *science*. Whereas implementation research can focus on scaling a particular intervention, implementation science is the broader study of the methods to scale and promote the adoption of interventions.
```

The research on RTS,S, will not end there, however. The vaccine may be efficacious, but that does not mean it will be easy or cost-effective to produce and deliver at a scale of millions. Studies that assess how best to get efficacious treatments to the people who need them most fall under the domain of **implementation research**. 

```{marginfigure}
Translational research was originally focused on moving from "bench to bedside", or from basic research in the lab to clinical research with humans. Today we recognize that other bottlenecks exist that prevent a good idea from making it out of the lab and ultimately impacting population health and policy. 
```

Making the jump from studies showing clinical efficacy to wide-spread adoption and population-level impact is one example of research translation. Practitioners of **translational research** point to 4 key bottlenecks:

* T1: Translation from basic science to clinical research
* T2: Translation from early clinical trials to Phase III trials and beyond with larger patient populations
* T3: Translation from efficacy trials (i.e., Phase III trials) to real-world effectiveness through implementation research
* T4: Translation from evidence about delivery at scale to the adoption of new policies

```
<br>

Translational research is cross-cutting, linked to several key bottlenecks where good ideas can stall and ultimately die.

### MONITORING AND EVALUATION

```{r basicapplied2, fig.cap="A research taxonomy, revisited.", echo=F, fig.margin=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/basicapplied.png", dpi = NA)
```

Another arena of applied work in global health is **monitoring and evaluation**, or M&E.


#### Evaluation{-}

In the United  States, program evaluation became commonplace by the end of the 1950s and grew dramatically in the 1960s as the federal government expanded and introduced new social programs. Lawmakers wanted accountability, and the evaluation of social programs took off [@rossi:2003]. ***But is program evaluation really research?*** 


```{marginfigure}
Campbell had an outsized impact on the field. It is no surprise that an organization dedicated to synthesizing the best available evidence on social interventions, the [Campbell Collaboration](http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/), bears his name.
```

Methods giant [Donald Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell) thought so:

> The United States and other modern nations should be ready for an experimental approach to social reform, an approach in which we try out new programs designed to cure specific problems, in which we learn whether or not these programs are effective, and in which we retain, imitate, modify or discard them on the basis of their effectiveness on the multiple imperfect criteria available [@campbell:1969].

But not everyone agrees. Some have argued that program evaluation is really designed for program implementers and funders, and that the messy nature of program implementation requires a loosening of research standards [@cronbach:1982]. We should simply evaluate the evidence, or "learn what we can." 

In their introductory text on evaluation, Rossi et al. [-@rossi:2003] strike a balance in views on this question of whether program evaluation is research. Their answer is perhaps a bit unsatisfying but is arguably true nevertheless: *It depends*. 

Program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less. Surely a lower bound in terms of quality or what is worthwhile exists, but the line is so context dependent that a simple rule is best: "Don't go beyond the data." Every organization wants to claim "impact," but not every evaluation can be based on the design and implementation.

##### Impact evaluation{-}

Revisiting the research taxonomy presented earlier, we see that there is overlap between evaluation (orange) and research (blue), a nod to Campbell's view that program evaluation can be considered research in many cases. Furthermore, we see that something called "impact evaluation" is a subset of evaluation. 

```{marginfigure}
A clinical trialist who works on Phase III studies is unlikely to refer to the trial as an "impact evaluation", even though the randomized study design is a type of impact evaluation. This language is more commonly used by economists and others who study the impact of social sector programs and interventions. For instance, see the [International Initiative for Impact Evaluation](http://www.3ieimpact.org/) (3ie) and the World Bank's [Development Impact Evaluation](http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) (DIME) group.
```

In an **impact evaluation**, the goal is to infer that some program—or some treatment, intervention, or policy—had an effect on some outcome. As we will discuss in later chapters, there are several research designs that will generate evidence of "impact". One design in particular, the randomized controlled trial common to Phase II and III clinical trials, is an important type of impact evaluation. Not all impact evaluations are RCTs, but all RCTs are impact evaluations.

#### Monitoring{-}

Program monitoring is concerned with the implementation of programs, policies, or interventions. How are resources being used? Is the program being delivered as intended (or *with fidelity*)? How many people participate, and does the program reach the intended targets? These are all program-monitoring questions.

Accurate monitoring is essential for reporting data to funders, but it is also essential for all good evaluations. The reason is simple: If a program fails—that is, has no impact—the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (**theory failure**)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (i.e., **implementation failure**)? Every trial should include ongoing monitoring or a formal process evaluation to assess the impact of the program on a continual basis.
