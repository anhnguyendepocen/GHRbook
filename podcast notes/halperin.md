I'm here with Dr. Daniel Halperin, author of the book "Tinderbox: How the West Sparked the AIDS Epidemic and How the World Can Finally Overcome It", co-authored with journalist Craig Timberg. Daniel, you are an epidemiologist and medical anthropologist with extensive experience studying HIV and AIDS as an academic, combatting its spread as the Senior HIV Prevention and Behavior Change Advisor at USAID, the US Agency for International Development, and consulting over the years with international partners to influence policy. You also had a front row seat to a fascinating piece of history in the fight against HIV and AIDS, which we will get to shortly.

But first, let's talk about how you first became interested in studying HIV and AIDS.

Today it's widely accepted that male circumcision offers men some degree of protection against HIV, and voluntary circumcision is an important component of our prevention efforts. In the last decade, more than 15 million men living in high prevalence parts of Africa have been circumcised, potentially averting more than half a million new HIV infections through 2030. But in the 1980s and early 1990s, the link between male circumcision and HIV was just a hunch. What led you to become an advocate for prevention through voluntary circumcision?

[Daniel talks about personally coming to believe there is an important link]

For a long time the medical and scientific community did not pay much attention to the possibility that the lack of male circumcision could be playing a role in the high rates of HIV observed in parts of Africa. You wrote a commentary for the Lancet in 2010 with Robert Bailey called, “Male circumcision and HIV infection: 10 years and counting”, that really took the field to task for ignoring what you considered to be compelling evidence for this link. What was it like to be one of the lone voices speaking up for many years against the scientific consensus?

[Daniel gives personal perspective on advocating for something that went against the scientific consensus at the time]

What do you think your experience and the story of male circumcision and HIV tells us about how research informs policy?

[Daniel offers some thoughts about the link between research and policy, drawing upon his experience]
