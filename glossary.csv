Term,Definition
scientific research,"Resarch where 1) the goal is inference, 2) the procedures are public, and 3) the conclusions are uncertain"
inference,the process of making conclusions about some unobserved or unmeasured phenomenon based on our direct observations of the world

deductive reasoning,reasoning that makes conclusions about some unobserved or unmeasured phenomenon based on direct observations of the world
mixed methods,designs that utilize both inductive and deductive reasoning

descriptive inference,goes beyond basic description (or collection of facts) to say something about how indiviudal experiences and opinions illuminate something more universal about the research problem at hand

preclinical research,"The clinical research phase in which testing is performed in non-human subjects with the goal of collecting data on how well the medication works (efficacy), how much damage it can do to an organism (toxicity), and how it is affected by the body (pharmacokinetics)."
Phase I,"In clinical research, a trial that utilizes a small sample size in order to find a safe dosing range and look for side effects."
Phase II,"In clinical research, studies that demonstrate the efficacy of the medication against several endpoints (a.k.a. outcomes). Includes Phase IIa and Phase IIb."

research question,
descriptive research,"Research that seeks to answer the question ""What is going on?"""

quasi-experimental design,
experimental design,"a design where researchers manipulate some independent variable and examine changes to some dependent variable that result (considered the ""gold standard"" of designs)"
prevalence,"Prevalence is the number of existing cases out of the total population at a point in time. In contrast to incidence, which is a measure of disease occurrence, prevalence is a measure of existing disease. Prevalence is unit-less."

sample,"In statistics, a sample refers to a set of observations drawn from a population."
correlational research,
dependent variable,"Also called the response variable or â€œy,â€ù the dependent variable is the â€œeffectâ€ù of the independent variable."
independent variable,"Also called the predictor variable or â€œx,â€ù the independent variable is the â€œcauseâ€ù of the dependent variable. In an experimental design, the independent variable is the variable that is manipulated by the experimenter."
point estimate,
confidence interval,"Statisticians use confidence intervals to express the degree of uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, if we compute a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean, we can be 95% confident that the true population mean falls in-between the lower and upper bounds of that confidence interval. That is, if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and computed an interval estimate for each sample, we would expect the true population parameter to fall within the interval estimates 95% of the time. Confidence intervals are often preferred to p-values because they give additional information about the precision of the point estimate."
