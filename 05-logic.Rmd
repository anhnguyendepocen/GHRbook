# Theory of Change {#logic}

If you run out of small talk at your next mixer for M&E professionals, ask people to tell you about their theory of change. You'll get an earful. Let's cover the basics so you too can become the life of the party.

## Overview

A **theory of change** articulates how an intervention—or a policy, program, or treatment—is expected to impact an outcome. It explains how X causes Y, and what is needed for this to happen. You might see this referred to as a logic model, logical framework, causal model, results chain, pipeline model, results framework, program theory, or one of several other combinations of these words. They all pretty much mean the same thing, but don't claim this at your party. I'll deny saying it.

I believe there are three stages to learning how to develop a theory of change (and logic models, results frameworks, etc): 

1. **Smugness**: This is so basic. I can't believe people write books about this.
2. **Confusion**: (*raises hand*) Wait, what is the difference between an outcome and and output again?
3. **Smugness**: That's an output, not an outcome. How do you expect your program to work if you can't articulate a clear theory of change?

Let's get started! 

## What Makes a Good Theory of Change?

The first time you encounter a program's theory of change, it will most likely be in the form of a graphic. This is not always a good thing. Just ask retired Army general [Stanley McChrystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_A._McChrystal).

```

When he saw this PowerPoint slide about the American military strategy in Afghanistan during a briefing in Kabul in 2009, Gen. McChrystal remarked, “When we understand that slide, we’ll have won the war.”[^ppt] And that is how it goes with theories of change. If your model is grounded in the evidence, testable, and clearly articulated, you might actually make an impact. If not, you lose.

Let's look at the theory of change for another USG effort to solve a protracted problem: hunger and poverty.

### A Plan to End Hunger and Poverty

In 2009, President Obama pledged $3.5 billon dollars over three years to a global hunger and food security initiative that came to be called [*Feed the Future*](http://www.feedthefuture.gov). FTF is said to take a "whole of government" approach. USAID and a coalition of 10 other federal agencies work in partnership with 19 focus countries, including Kenya, to promote agricultural development and end poverty and hunger.

The 2010-15 strategy document for the FTF portfolio in Kenya exemplifies how large donors like the USG use theories of change in support of global health and development initiatives[@ftf:2011]. Here is how the theory of change is explained in the text:

> To generate the economic growth needed to reduce poverty and hunger and to achieve the GOK’s vision of a commercial and modern agricultural sector, FTF in Kenya will invest in transforming agriculture through improved competitiveness of high-potential value chains and the promotion of diversification into higher-return, on- and off-farm activities. As documented by IFPRI, the development of selected value chains will have multiplier effects that spawn off- and non-farm employment opportunities.

This is known as development speak. One of the hallmarks of development speak is that you reach the end of the paragraph, nod in approval, and then say "wait, what?", suddenly realizing you know less than you did when you started the paragraph.
```

This diagram (more) clearly depicts what the report prose struggles to do:

### Core Components

Theory of change diagrams come in a variety of flavors. There is no RIGHT WAY™ to create one, as long as you can convey the fundamentals of how X leads to Y. If people understand your diagram, it is a good diagram.

People are more likely to understand your diagram and your theory of change if you include a few common elements. The United Kingdom's Department for International Development, commonly known as DFID or UK Aid, commissioned a report on the uses of theories of change in international development that identified several common components:[^def] 

[^def]: Consensus on the definition of 'theory of change' remains elusive.

* influence of context
* discussion of long-term change
* process/sequence of change explained
* underlying assumptions
* presented as a diagram and narrative summary

Going by this list, the FTF diagram could be improved by the addition of contextual factors and underlying factors.

#### Templates are your friend{-}

My preferred approach to outlining a theory of change is to follow this template from the [W.K. Kellogg Foundation](http://www.wkkf.org/resource-directory/resource/2006/02/wk-kellogg-foundation-logic-model-development-guide). Here is an [editable PowerPoint version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxn_jkXZ1lxueEVVVXJlVU5vaU0).

```

Start with the (research) problem statement (**Box 1**). This box gets at the heart of the reason your intervention exists. What are you trying to solve? You'd be surprised how often program design is disconnected from the problem that led to the program in the first place. This planning process will help you prevent you from ending up in this situation.

Next think about what assets already exist and what needs remain (**Box 2**). There is always something to build upon, which is why it's important to look for strengths in addition to challenges. This process is best done in collaboration with people impacted by the problem so that the proposed solution is grounded in their reality. If available, descriptive data sources like the DHS can help to outline (1) and (2). For a more local perspective, it might be beneficial to conduct a brief needs assessment in partnership with the local community if resources permit.

**Box 3** jumps to the desired results. If the program works, what will change? We'll come back to what is meant by "outputs, outcomes, and impact" in a moment. With the results articulated, you can go back to the beginning and consider what factors might affect your program's success positively or negatively (**Box 4**).

The next step is to outline strategies for achieving your desired results that take into account potential barriers and facilitators (**Box 5**). This is where you articulate what your program will actually do.

Finally, **Box 6** reminds you that every theory of change is built on a set of assumptions. Be thorough and transparent as you think through the hidden beliefs that underlie your ideas about how your program will achieve its results.

##### Example: Kenyan "Sugar Daddies"{-}

In 2014, an [estimated 1.4 million](http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/kenya) people in Kenya were living with HIV. This is a prevalence rate of 5.3% among adults aged 15 to 49. Without a cure for AIDS, prevention remains critical to ending the epidemic. 

Starting in 2001, Kenya integrated HIV/AIDS education into the primary school curriculum as a new prevention strategy [jpal:2007]. At the time, the focus of this program—and many others programs across sub-Saharan Africa—was complete *risk avoidance* [@dupas:2011]. Abstinence. Information on *risk reduction* was limited. In particular, students were not learning about the differential prevalence of HIV infection by age and gender. Girls were not learn that the older "sugar daddies" who provide nice things like phones and airtime in return for sex are more likely than the girls' goofy age mates to be infected.

An organization called [ICS Africa](http://www.ics.nl/en/home/) set out to change this by rolling out a "Relative Risk Information Campaign" in Kenya. The intervention was brilliant in its simplicity. A program staffer would talk with students for 40 minutes. During this time, the staffer showed the class a 10-minute video on sugar daddies and led a discussion about cross-generational sex. During the session, the staffer reviewed results of recent studies and wrote facts about the distribution of HIV prevalence on the chalk board.

JPAL researchers tested ICS Africa's risk reduction strategy in a randomized experiment in Western Kenya. In the first phase (2003), 328 schools were randomized to teacher training on the national HIV prevention curriculum [@duflo:2006]. In the second phase (2004), 71 of these schools were stratified and randomized to receive the sugar daddy intervention [@dupas:2011]. In total there were four study arms: (i) teacher training only, (ii) sugar daddy only, (iii) teacher training and sugar daddy, and (iv) nothing.

The results were shocking. Teacher training was a bust. Sure, the training led to a change in teaching practices—notably that trained teachers mentioned HIV in class more often than non-trained teachers—but it had little effect on HIV knowledge or childbearing.

```{block, type='rmdcomment'}
Increasing knowledge about HIV makes intuitive sense as an outcome for a study about HIV prevention. But why childbearing? 

Well, babies don't come from storks. They come from unprotected sex. It's harder to lie about birthing a baby than it is to lie about your private sexual behavior, so childbearing is thought to be a more objective measure of unprotected sex. Unprotected sex is a main driver of HIV transmission, so measuring childbearing is a proxy for HIV risk from unprotected sex. 
```

In contrast, the 40-minute sugar daddy discussion and video reduced childbearing with men at least five years older by 65%—and not because girls started having babies with males their own age. The overall incidence of childbearing fell by 28%. With a cost of $28.20 USD per school and $0.80 per student, the cost per childbirth averted was $91 [@jpal:2007].

Returning to our template, let's piece together the theory of change for the relative risk reduction program.

## Other Approaches

While a theory of change tends to be a high-level depiction of the "why", other approaches are more detailed and focus on the "how". 

### Results Framework

Donors like USAID commonly require project staff to create **results frameworks** to monitor progress toward achieving the stated goals. Here's an example results framework from the *Feed the Future* strategic plan for Kenya.

```{r resultsframe, fig.cap="FTF Results Framework. Source: Feed the Future, http://1.usa.gov/1NDuQpn", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ftfrf.png", dpi = NA)
```

You can read this diagram from the top down. The overall goal reflects the mission of the broader FTF program: reduce poverty and hunger. The plan for attaining this goal is to reach two objectives: inclusive agricultural sector growth and improved nutritional status.

If the goal represents the ultimate desired impact, objectives are long range strategies. You know you are on track to reaching your objectives if you hit several intermediate results, or IRs. For instance, IR6, "Improved utilization of MCH and nutrition services", is expected to improve the nutritional status of women and children. This IR has three sub IRs, including 6.3 "Strengthened MCH nutrition surveillance". The rationale for sub-IR 6.3 is that better monitoring and data will enable earlier identification of at-risk individuals, which in turn should mean earlier initiation of nutrition interventions.

Every IR has a set of indicators for measuring progress. In the case of IR6, FTF lists the following illustrative indicators:

* prevalence of maternal anemia
* number of children under five years of age who received vitamin A from USG-supported programs
* number of people trained in child health and nutrition through USG-supported health area programs (disaggregated by gender)
* number of clients who received food and/or nutrition services (PEPFAR
indicator)

### Logic Models

DFID requires grantees to prepare **logic models**—or [logframes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-how-to-note-guidance-on-using-the-revised-logical-framework) as they like to say—for planning, monitoring program implementation, and program evaluation and reporting. Logic models take the "results chain" or "pipeline" approach shown below.

```{r logicmodel, fig.cap="Logic model. Source: W.K. Kellogg Foundation, http://bit.ly/1My75Ay", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wkkflog.png", dpi = NA)
```

In a logic model, inputs and activities represent your planned work. Outputs, outcomes, and impact are your intended results.

**Inputs**: The resources needed to implement the program. People, money, time, etc.

**Activities**: What your program will do. Trainings, events, distribution of goods, etc.

**Outputs**: What your program did. Number of people trained, number of events held, number of goods delivered and number of people who benefitted.

**Outcomes**: Short- and medium-term results of your program. Increased knowledge, decreased risky behavior, improved functioning, etc.

**Impacts**: Long-term effects of the program outcomes. Lower HIV prevalence, reduced morbidity and mortality, etc.

Here's what a logic model might look like for the Kenyan relative risk reduction program.
