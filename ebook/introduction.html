Typically, it means <strong>donors</strong> (i.e., the public and private organizations that fund research programs), <strong>policy makers</strong> (i.e., government officials and bureaucrats at national or international bodies like the CDC or the WHO), and <strong>program implementers</strong> (e.g., organizations like Doctors Without Borders) that actually deliver services to <strong>beneficiaries</strong> (i.e., individuals, populations, or patients), and it even extends to <strong>scholars</strong> who study a particular topic or policy issue.

<h5>Case study: Developing a malaria vaccine</h5>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>The development of a vaccine for malaria provides a good example of the life cycle of a clinical trial. In 2015, after 30 years of research, a vaccine candidate called RTS,S, or Mosquirix™, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/news/malaria-vaccine-bill-gates/">made the news</a> for having gotten one step closer to becoming a licensed vaccine after a successful Phase III trial.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p><a href="http://malariavaccine.org/files/UpdatedRTSS_FactSheet_21April2010.pdf">Development of RTS,S</a> began in 1984 through a partnership between the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. In 1987, a promising vaccine candidate entered <strong>preclinical</strong> research. During the preclinical phase, researchers performed tests on nonhuman subjects to collect data on how well the vaccine worked (efficacy), how much damage it could do to an organism (toxicity), and how the body affected the vaccine (pharmacokinetics).</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>Clinical research on humans began in 1992. To obtain regulatory approval, the vaccine had to complete three phases of testing. Doherty et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-doherty:1999">1999</a>)</span> conducted a <strong>Phase I</strong> safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. This small sample size is typical of Phase I trials, where the main objectives are usually to determine a safe dosing range and to evaluate side effects. These researchers reported that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>Several <strong>Phase II</strong> studies conducted over the following decade (Phase IIa and Phase IIb) demonstrated the <strong>efficacy</strong> of the vaccine against several end points (or outcomes) <span class="citation">(Moorthy and Ballou <a href="references.html#ref-moorthy:2009">2009</a>)</span>. A Phase IIb trial began in Mozambique in 2003 with more than 2,000 children aged 1 to 4 years <span class="citation">(Alonso et al. <a href="references.html#ref-alonso:2004">2004</a>)</span>. Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. A follow-up study with 214 infants also showed partial protection from malaria <span class="citation">(Aponte et al. <a href="references.html#ref-aponte:2007">2007</a>)</span>. This Phase II trial was an important proof-of-concept study.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>The final results of a large <strong>Phase III</strong> trial with more than 15,000 infants and young children in 7 African countries were published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 2015 <span class="citation">(RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership <a href="references.html#ref-rts:2015">2015</a>)</span>. Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (a) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (b) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (c) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3–4-year period. This Phase III trial achieved its goal—to show that the treatment was efficacious.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>On the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a “European scientific opinion” to help inform the decision of the WHO and African national regulatory authorities regarding their recommendation of the vaccine. If RTS,S is approved for use and eventually hits the market, researchers will likely conduct <strong>Phase IV</strong> trials to evaluate the vaccine’s long-term effects.</p></div></div>

<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>The research on RTS,S, will not end there, however. The vaccine may be efficacious, but that does not mean it will be easy or cost-effective to produce and deliver at a scale of millions. Studies that assess how best to get efficacious treatments to the people who need them most fall under the domain of <strong>implementation science</strong>.</p></div></div>

<li>T2: Translation from early clinical trials to Phase III trials and beyond with larger patient populations</li>

<h5>Evaluation</h5>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-9"><p>In the United States, program evaluation became commonplace by the end of the 1950s and grew dramatically in the 1960s as the federal government expanded and introduced new social programs. Lawmakers wanted accountability, and the evaluation of social programs took off <span class="citation">(Rossi, Lipsey, and Freeman <a href="references.html#ref-rossi:2003">2003</a>)</span>. <strong><em>But is program evaluation really research?</em></strong> Methods giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell">Donald Campbell</a> thought so:</p></div>
<div class="col-sm-3 margin-note">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Campbell had an outsized impact on the field. It is no surprise that an organization dedicated to synthesizing the best available evidence on social interventions, the <a href="http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/">Campbell Collaboration</a>, bears his name.

<blockquote>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>The United States and other modern nations should be ready for an experimental approach to social reform, an approach in which we try out new programs designed to cure specific problems, in which we learn whether or not these programs are effective, and in which we retain, imitate, modify or discard them on the basis of their effectiveness on the multiple imperfect criteria available <span class="citation">(Campbell <a href="references.html#ref-campbell:1969">1969</a>)</span>.</p></div></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>But not everyone agrees. Some have argued that program evaluation is really designed for program implementers and funders, and that the messy nature of program implementation requires a loosening of research standards <span class="citation">(Cronbach <a href="references.html#ref-cronbach:1982">1982</a>)</span> and simply evaluate the evidence, or “learn what you can.”</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>In their introductory text on evaluation, Rossi et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rossi:2003">2003</a>)</span> strike a balance in views. Their answer is perhaps a bit unsatisfying but is arguably true nevertheless: <em>It depends</em>.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>Program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less. Surely a lower bound in terms of quality or what is worthwhile exists, but the line is so context dependent that a simple rule is best: “Don’t go beyond the data.” Every organization wants to claim “impact,” but not every evaluation can be based on the design and implementation.</p></div></div>

<h5>Monitoring</h5>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>Program monitoring is concerned with the implementation of programs, policies, or interventions. How are resources being used? Is the program being delivered as intended (or <em>with fidelity</em>)? How many people participate, and does the program reach the intended targets? These are all program-monitoring questions.</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><p>Accurate monitoring is essential for reporting data to funders, but it is also essential for all good evaluations. The reason is simple: If a program fails—that is, has no impact—the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (<strong>theory failure</strong>)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (i.e., <strong>implementation failure</strong>)? Every trial should include ongoing monitoring or a formal process evaluation to assess the impact of the program on a continual basis.</p></div></div>
