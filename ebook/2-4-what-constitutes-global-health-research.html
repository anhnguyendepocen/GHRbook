<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> What Constitutes Global Health Research?</h2>
<p>Like any scientific endeavor, global health research begins with basic research founded in principles of hard science. This is only the beginning, however; basic research constitutes only a small portion of the overall body of ongoing research. The areas of applied exploration built on this foundation include the clinical arenas from which important global health changes emerge.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> BASIC RESEARCH</h3>
<p><strong>Basic research</strong>—or “pure” research—is the pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena. For example, scientists conduct laboratory experiments to understand the parasitic life cycle and how parasites interact with humans at different stages. Likewise, basic ecology research seeks to understand plant species diversity. The information generated by basic science becomes the universally acknowledged background for more advanced research—applied science.</p>
</div>
<div id="applied-research" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> APPLIED RESEARCH</h3>
<p>Basic research is different than <strong>applied research</strong>, which focuses on specific problems or applications in several ways. For instance, an applied research question might be, “How can we increase the coverage and use of bed nets that prevent malaria transmission?” The basic science, such as the behavioral habits of the mosquito and the transmission conditions for malaria, have already been determined by entomologists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>Applied science takes many different forms, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"><strong>clinical research</strong></a>. Clinical research is a broad field that encompasses patient-oriented research, epidemiological and behavioral studies, outcomes research, and health services research.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> Glossary of Terms for Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion Issues, based on the 1997 Report of the NIH Director’s Panel on Clinical Research, entry: “clinical research”.

<div id="clinical-trials" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Clinical Trials</h4>
<p>One type of clinical research is a clinical trial. Drugs and vaccines have to pass through different phases of clinical trials before regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will approve their use with humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preclinical research</li>
<li>Phase I</li>
<li>Phase II</li>
<li>Phase III</li>
<li>Phase IV</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavioral research (e.g., development and evaluation of parenting interventions) does not follow the same exact phases of vaccine and drug development, but the broad principles are the same.</p>
<div id="case-study-developing-a-malaria-vaccine" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Case study: Developing a malaria vaccine</h5>
<p>The development of a vaccine for malaria provides a good example of the life cycle of a clinical trial. In 2015, after 30 years of research, a vaccine candidate called RTS,S, or Mosquirix™, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/news/malaria-vaccine-bill-gates/">made the news</a> for having gotten one step closer to becoming a licensed vaccine after a successful Phase III trial.</p>
<p><a href="http://malariavaccine.org/files/UpdatedRTSS_FactSheet_21April2010.pdf">Development of RTS,S</a> began in 1984 through a partnership between the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. In 1987, a promising vaccine candidate entered <strong>preclinical</strong> research. During the preclinical phase, researchers performed tests on nonhuman subjects to collect data on how well the vaccine worked (efficacy), how much damage it could do to an organism (toxicity), and how the body affected the vaccine (pharmacokinetics).</p>
<p>Clinical research on humans began in 1992. To obtain regulatory approval, the vaccine had to complete three phases of testing. Doherty et al. <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">1999<span class="marginnote">Doherty, JF, M Pinder, N Tornieporth, C Carton, L Vigneron, P Milligan, WR Ballou, et al. 1999. “A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial with the Candidate Malaria Vaccine Rts, S/Sbas2 in Semi-Immune Adults in the Gambia.” <em>The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</em> 61 (6): 865–68. <a href="The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 61(6)*](http://www.ajtmh.org/content/61/6/865.full.pdf+html">The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 61(6)*](http://www.ajtmh.org/content/61/6/865.full.pdf+html</a>.</span>)</span> conducted a <strong>Phase I</strong> safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. This small sample size is typical of Phase I trials, where the main objectives are usually to determine a safe dosing range and to evaluate side effects. These researchers reported that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies.</p>
<p>Several <strong>Phase II</strong> studies conducted over the following decade (Phase IIa and Phase IIb) demonstrated the <strong>efficacy</strong> of the vaccine against several end points (or outcomes) <span class="citation">(Moorthy and Ballou <label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">2009<span class="marginnote">Moorthy, V.

Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. A follow-up study with 214 infants also showed partial protection from malaria <span class="citation">(Aponte et al. <label for="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">2007<span class="marginnote">Aponte, John J, Pedro Aide, Montse Renom, Inacio Mandomando, Quique Bassat, Jahit Sacarlal, M Nelia Manaca, et al. 2007. “Safety of the Rts, S/As02d Candidate Malaria Vaccine in Infants Living in a Highly Endemic Area of Mozambique: A Double Blind Randomised Controlled Phase I/Iib Trial.” <em>The Lancet</em> 370 (9598): 1543–51. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17949807">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17949807</a>.</span>)</span>.

Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (a) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (b) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (c) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3–4-year period. This Phase III trial achieved its goal—to show that the treatment was efficacious.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a “European scientific opinion” to help inform the decision of the WHO and African national regulatory authorities regarding their recommendation of the vaccine. If RTS,S is approved for use and eventually hits the market, researchers will likely conduct <strong>Phase IV</strong> trials to evaluate the vaccine’s long-term effects.</p>
</div>

<div id="implementation-science-and-translational-research" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Implementation Science and Translational Research</h4>
<p>The research on RTS,S, will not end there, however. The vaccine may be efficacious, but that does not mean it will be easy or cost-effective to produce and deliver at a scale of millions. Studies that assess how best to get efficacious treatments to the people who need them most fall under the domain of <strong>implementation science</strong>.</p>
<p>Many stumbling blocks face interventions in the process of moving from “bench to bedside.” Practitioners of <strong>translational research</strong> point to 4 key bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
<li>T1: Translation from basic science to clinical research</li>
<li>T2: Translation from early clinical trials to Phase III trials and beyond with larger patient populations</li>
<li>T3: Translation from efficacy trials (i.e., Phase III trials) to real-world effectiveness through implementation science</li>
<li>T4: Translation from evidence about delivery at scale to the adoption of new policies</li>

<h4>Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>
<p>Another arena of applied science in global health is <strong>monitoring and evaluation</strong>, or M&amp;E.</p>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Evaluation</h5>
<p>In the United States, program evaluation became commonplace by the end of the 1950s and grew dramatically in the 1960s as the federal government expanded and introduced new social programs. Lawmakers wanted accountability, and the evaluation of social programs took off <span class="citation">(Rossi, Lipsey, and Freeman <label for="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">2003<span class="marginnote">Rossi, P.

Sage Publications. <a href="http://amzn.to/1TlIqoa">http://amzn.to/1TlIqoa</a>.</span>)</span>. <strong><em>But is program evaluation really research?</em></strong> Methods giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell">Donald Campbell</a> thought so:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-3 margin-note">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Campbell had an outsized impact on the field. It is no surprise that an organization dedicated to synthesizing the best available evidence on social interventions, the <a href="http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/">Campbell Collaboration</a>, bears his name.

<blockquote>
<p>The United States and other modern nations should be ready for an experimental approach to social reform, an approach in which we try out new programs designed to cure specific problems, in which we learn whether or not these programs are effective, and in which we retain, imitate, modify or discard them on the basis of their effectiveness on the multiple imperfect criteria available <span class="citation">(Campbell <label for="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">1969<span class="marginnote">Campbell, D.

</blockquote>
<p>But not everyone agrees. Some have argued that program evaluation is really designed for program implementers and funders, and that the messy nature of program implementation requires a loosening of research standards <span class="citation">(Cronbach <label for="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">1982<span class="marginnote">Cronbach, L. J. 1982. <em>Designing Evaluations of Educational and Social Programs</em>. Jossey-Bass. <a href="http://amzn.to/1L4gxwx">http://amzn.to/1L4gxwx</a>.</span>)</span> and simply evaluate the evidence, or “learn what you can.”</p>
<p>In their introductory text on evaluation, Rossi et al. <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">2003<span class="marginnote">Rossi, P. H., M. W. Lipsey, and H. E. Freeman. 2003. <em>Evaluation: A Systematic Approach</em>. Sage Publications. <a href="http://amzn.to/1TlIqoa">http://amzn.to/1TlIqoa</a>.</span>)</span> strike a balance in views on this question of whether program evaluation is research. Their answer is perhaps a bit unsatisfying but is arguably true nevertheless: <em>It depends</em>.</p>
<p>Program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less. Surely a lower bound in terms of quality or what is worthwhile exists, but the line is so context dependent that a simple rule is best: “Don’t go beyond the data.” Every organization wants to claim “impact,” but not every evaluation can be based on the design and implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="monitoring" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Monitoring</h5>
<p>Program monitoring is concerned with the implementation of programs, policies, or interventions. How are resources being used? Is the program being delivered as intended (or <em>with fidelity</em>)? How many people participate, and does the program reach the intended targets? These are all program-monitoring questions.</p>
<p>Accurate monitoring is essential for reporting data to funders, but it is also essential for all good evaluations. The reason is simple: If a program fails—that is, has no impact—the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (<strong>theory failure</strong>)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (i.e., <strong>implementation failure</strong>)? Every trial should include ongoing monitoring or a formal process evaluation to assess the impact of the program on a continual basis.</p>
