<p>As health professionals and researchers, we have a duty to make recommendations and decisions based on evidence, not beliefs. The term “evidence-based” first came into use in the 1990s, nearly two decades after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Cochrane">Archie Cochrane</a>, the father of evidence-based medicine and namesake of the Cochrane Reviews, wrote the book “<a href="https://amzn.to/2WEgmnr">Effectiveness and Efficiency</a>” and pointed to the need for the medical field to learn from the highest quality studies. This struck a chord with the profession, and medical schools began teaching their students <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"><strong>evidence-based medicine</strong></a> (EBM), defined by <span class="citation">Sackett et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-sackett:1996">1996</a>)</span> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of the individual patient. It means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, evidence-based medicine has expanded to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice">evidence-based <em>practice</em></a> (or EBP) more generally, as well as to population-level approaches such as evidence-based public health <span class="citation">(Brownson, Fielding, and Maylahn <a href="references.html#ref-brownson:2009">2009</a>)</span> and evidence-based global health policy <span class="citation">(Yamey and Feachem <a href="references.html#ref-yamey:2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This focus on evidence has saved countless lives and improved health around the globe. But how does data become evidence? Each year a few million new articles enter the scientific literature <span class="citation">(Ware and Mabe <a href="references.html#ref-ware2015">2015</a>)</span>. Who determines what should be published and which studies should be designated as “high quality” evidence?</p>
<p>Well, we do. As scientists and researchers, we review manuscripts from our colleagues prior to publication, comment on articles once they appear in print, prepare systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published work, and sometimes attempt to replicate published findings in new studies. Broadly speaking, this process is known as <strong>critical appraisal</strong>, and it is the focus of this chapter.</p>

<p>We are constant consumers of health research. Every day we read or listen to dozens of headlines that put our critical appraisal skills to the test.

<p>Creator and curator <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesheathers">James Heathers</a> describes his motivation to call out bad reporting <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/in-mice-explained-77b61b598218">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept is simple — a lot of science news reporting (which I distinguish from science journalism) is framed badly. Many elements of it grind my gears, and the worst amongst them is: Reporting preliminary animal research out of context. Often the easiest way to fix it is appending a simple suffix: IN MICE.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, it could be “in cell lines” or “in guinea pigs” or “in Drosophila” or “in white boys wearing boat shoes at a college in the midwest”, but — it’s usually mice. So many stories about the Latest Thing That You Need To Know About What Will Kill You Next Tuesday can have their accuracy dramatically improved by the simple addition of IN MICE.</p>

Drinking 25 cups of coffee a day is still safe for the heart, <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1135489168698724352">study says</a>.<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/coffee-snow-white-3oriO04qxVReM5rJEA"> via GIPHY.</a>
</span></span></p>
<p>Journalists love research on animal models and studies of lifestyle topics because we, the news consumers, crave stories that give us hope for potential cures or reassure us that we really can drink 52 cups of coffee a day and live to tell about it. One problem is that these studies often represent the start of the scientific process, not the end. In a great piece of reporting by Brian Resnick in <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/3/14792174/half-scientific-studies-news-are-wrong">Vox</a>, he shares a study by <span class="citation">Dumas-Mallet et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-dumas2017">2017</a>)</span> in which the authors tracked the press coverage of nearly 5,000 biomedical studies included in 306 meta-analyses. They found that journalists are 5x more likely to cover initial studies compared to follow-up studies and are largely uninterested in null results. This focus on the flashy is a problem because only a third of studies were backed up by subsequent research.</p>
<p>But are journalists to blame? Not entirely. Many journalists <a href="https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/productivity-stories-news.php">publish several stories per day</a> and rely on the press releases that universities and researchers put out when study results are published. Folks, it looks like we might be the source of many exaggerated claims.</p>

<p>In a study published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, <span class="citation">Sumner et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-sumner2014">2014</a>)</span> reviewed 462 press releases and 668 news stories about scholarly articles published by the top 20 research universities in the UK. They found that 40% of the university press releases contained exaggerated advice not supported by the research, and that these exaggerations were repeated in news articles more often than not. It is tempting to fault the university press office, but it is common practice for researchers to approve the press release copy before it is published. Improving science reporting starts with us.</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-review" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Peer Review</h2>
<p>Before study results can become news headlines, the claims must be vetted in a process known as <strong>peer review</strong>. In peer review, scholars working in the same field as the researcher read and comment on whether a manuscript is suitable for publication in an <strong>academic (i.e. scholarly) journal</strong>. It is not a perfect system—and many argue that <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/29/13770988/peer-review-bias-authors">peer review is broken</a>—but it here to stay, so I will outline the process and explain how peer review is critical appraisal.</p>
<div id="initial-screening" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>INITIAL SCREENING</h3>
<p>The review process begins when an author sends a manuscript to a journal. Typically, each submission is screened by the journal’s editor, a role often filled by a senior scientist in the journal’s field. If the editor thinks that the research is free of obvious fatal flaws and that the paper will be of interest the journal’s readership, then the editor assigns it to an associate editor with some expertise on the topic to manage the peer-review process. Some manuscripts never make it this far; the editor does a “desk reject” and the peer review process ends before it can even begin.</p>
</div>
<div id="inviting-peer-reviewers" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>INVITING PEER REVIEWERS</h3>
<p>If not desk rejected, an associate editor invites 2-4 (or more) scholars in the research field—peers of the authors we call reviewers or referees—to review the paper and comment on the merits of the study. Some journals allow (or even require) authors to recommend reviewers who might be a good fit for their research and to request that certain colleagues not be considered. Competition within a field, competition for funding resources, and the race to publish original research are a few of the reasons an author might wish to avoid having their unpublished research under the eyes of certain colleagues. The editorial team does not always respect an author’s wishes, but finding appropriate reviewers is challenging, and they usually consider these suggestions.</p>
<p>There is no one model for who is considered a ‘peer’. A peer can be someone at the same level as the author, more junior, or more senior. Editors might ask a scholar to review a paper because they have published similar work, or because they have expertise in the method of data collection or analysis. When editors struggle to find reviewers for a paper, however, the definition of peer can loosen.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-to-acceptdecline-invitations" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>WHEN TO ACCEPT/DECLINE INVITATIONS</h3>
<p>In most cases, peer review is an unpaid service to the field. Manuscript length varies a lot by discipline, but it is not unheard of for referees to spend 5 hours or more reading your paper and writing a report. For this unpaid effort, reviewers might be mentioned in the journal’s annual list of contributors; but for the most part, peer review is a quiet contribution to science.</p>
<p>Given the importance of peer review and the time required to do justice to the process, many invitations are declined. <span class="citation">Willis (<a href="references.html#ref-willis2016">2016</a>)</span> studied review invitations sent over a 5-month period for an unspecified health science journal published by Wiley and found that 30% of invitations were declined. Reasons for declining included not being available (83%), “not my field” (14%), and conflict of interest (3%).</p>
<p>It is customary to decline an invitation to review a manuscript if you have worked closely with the authorship team or are a member of the same institution. Likewise, it is appropriate to decline if you do not feel qualified to comment on the topic or the methods. If you compete with the authors for funding in a niche area and you choose to accept the invitation, it is important to be transparent with the editor about your potential conflicts of interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-peer-review-always-blind" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> IS PEER REVIEW ALWAYS BLIND?</h3>
<p>Traditionally, peer review has been conducted in a blinded fashion in which the author and the reviewer are unaware of each other’s identities. Some journals have discontinued the practice of blinding author identities from reviewers because the citations and descriptions of the work often give away the group behind the research (or it is a moot point because the authors have published a pre-print). And some reviewers have adopted the practice of signing their reviews in a push for transparency. But peer review is still characterized by secrecy in many disciplines. It is even possible at many journals to submit private comments to the editor that the authors never see!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, proponents of open science can claim small victory in the adoption of some form of open peer review in some corners of the scientific community. What we mean by “open” can vary, however <span class="citation">(Ross-Hellauer <a href="references.html#ref-ross2017">2017</a>)</span>. Sometimes open simply means that the identities of reviewers and authors is known to both parties. But for some journals, open means publishing reviewer reports alongside the manuscript.</p>
<p>For instance, at <a href="https://gatesopenresearch.org/">Gates Open Research</a>, a publishing platform funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reviewer names are published online with their written reviews. On the author side, Gates Open Research publishes all iterations of the article, along with the data and code to replicate the manuscript.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to have strong opinions about open peer review. Some believe that open peer review will make it harder for peers to provide honest feedback. Proponents of the process would counter that an open process forces reviewers to be more thoughtful and constructive in their reports. Let’s face it, peer review can be nasty.</p>

<p>Whether you sign your name or not—and there are legitimate reasons to be hesitant, especially as an early career researcher reviewing the work of senior colleagues—being charitable and constructive in your reviews is a basic courtesy you can offer.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-happens-during-the-review-process" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS?</h3>
<p>Often Reviewers sometimes reveal themselves inadvertently by recommending that the author cite a lot of their work, and authors or research group’s identity because their current work builds on previous studies or because various parts of their work have been presented at scientific conferences. The scientific community is a small world, especially in highly specialized fields.</p>
<p>Once the manuscript of a research study arrives on a reviewer’s desk, he or she will take a few weeks (or even months!) to recommend that the paper be rejected or accepted with minor or major revisions (or sometimes no revisions at all). Some reviewers enumerate the perceived flaws in painstaking detail. Others give short or vague feedback that may be of little help to the author or the editor.</p>
<p>When the editorial team receives these reviews, they decide how the manuscript will proceed. Most academics are happy to get a “revise and resubmit” letter (also called an “R&amp;R” letter). The editor usually gives an indication that the revised paper will have a good chance of publication when it revised, but there are no guarantees. Even after the original paper is revised it sometimes goes back out for further peer review, or the editor makes the decision to accept the revision without additional input.</p>
<p>The editor has a difficult task because reviewers often take different positions regarding a submission. As Smith <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-smith:2006">2006</a>)</span> suggested, the recommendations of multiple reviews can be in direct opposition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Reviewer A: `I found this paper to be extremely muddled with a large number of deficits’</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Reviewer B: `This paper is written in a clear style and would be understood by any reader’.</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-does-not-happen" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> WHAT DOES NOT HAPPEN?</h3>
<p>nor is it a guarantee of “truth” or validation of the results, but</p>
<p>A critical thing to note, however, is that reviewers almost never have access to a researcher’s data or analysis code. They base their decisions on the methods as they are reported, the results as they are presented, and the conclusions reached by the author in the discussion. At this stage, the data sources must be described, but they are not verified. So even if reviewers find possible flaws in the logic of the research, analysis mistakes and fraud go largely unchecked.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Andrew Gelman, a statistician at Columbia University writes a great (non–peer-reviewed) blog and comments regularly on the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2016/02/01/peer-review-make-no-damn-sense/">limitations of peer review</a> and the need for more post-publication review.</span> This lack of verification is why it is wrong to conclude that publication in a peer-reviewed journal means validation, or assurance of the correctness of the conclusions drawn. “Published” does not equal “correct.”<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> Authors and journal editors sometimes learn about mistakes and decide to publish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erratum"><strong>corrigendum</strong></a> or even retract the paper.

</div>
<div id="peer-review-of-funding-proposals" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> PEER REVIEW OF FUNDING PROPOSALS</h3>
<p>Funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) also use a peer-review process to make funding decisions. When a grant application is submitted to an institute at the NIH, a Scientific Review Officer (SRO) checks the proposal for completeness and assigns it to several peer reviewers serving on a Scientific Review Group. The reviewers write up their critiques and assign a <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/review/rev_prep/scoring.htm">score from 1 (exceptional) to 9 (poor)</a>. If the preliminary score is too high, the full committee may not discuss the application, which kills the opportunity for funding, at least for that version of the proposal.</p>
<p>If an application, i.e., the study proposal, is discussed, the committee assigns a final score (multiplied by 10 for a final rank of 10–90). A summary statement with comments, the overall impact score, and the percentile score is prepared and returned to the applicant. If the proposal exceeds the payline, a percentile score that most institutes set based on the available budget, then the proposal will likely be funded. The overall <a href="https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm">success rate</a> for research grant applications in 2015 was 18.3%.</p>

He has written several books on data analysis and has created a few helpful guides like <a href="https://github.com/jtleek/reviews">this one on peer review</a>.</span> with some amendments:</p>

Journal space constraints make this challenging, so authors often post supplemental materials online that provide additional details.<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> Supplemental materials are often published online “as is,” meaning that the files are not typeset, edited, or peer reviewed.</span> Even with supplemental materials, however, it may be necessary to contact an author before attempting a replication.</p>
<p>The organization of the <em>Methods</em> section varies by discipline and journal, but generally it includes some information about the research design, subjects, materials or measures, data sources and procedures, and analysis strategy. The <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/"><strong>Equator Network</strong></a>, which awkwardly stands for Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research, is a good resource for understanding modern reporting standards. When preparing a manuscript, most journals expect authors to follow the appropriate checklist for the study design.</p>
<div class="rmdtip">
<p>
Include the completed checklist as an appendix with the article submission to head off reviewers who may complain about missing information that is definitely included.

<div id="is-the-research-design-well-suited-to-answer-the-research-question" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Is the research design well-suited to answer the research question?</h4>
<p>There are many different designs that can potentially answer most research questions, but not all designs are created equal. A graphic like Figure <a href="critical.html#fig:loe">4.1</a> is commonly used in the EBM literature to convey this point. The meta-analyses and systematic reviews in <strong><a href="literature">Chapter 3</a></strong> are ‘studies of studies,’ and they sit atop the evidence hierarchy. They enjoy this status because they synthesize the best available evidence. No one study is the final word on a research question, so it makes sense that a meta-analysis that pools results and accounts for variable study quality could potentially provide a better answer than any one study alone.</p>

</div>
<p>However, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-cochrane">2011</a>)</span> cautions researchers to pay attention to design features (e.g., how participants were selected) rather than labels (e.g., cohort study) because such labels are broad categories. Therefore, this hierarchy is not absolute; these rankings reflect ideals. For example, RCTs can be poorly designed or poorly implemented, and the evidence from such a flawed study is not necessarily better than the evidence from a nonrandomized study just because it carries the label “randomized.”</p>
<div id="is-there-a-risk-of-bias-and-confounding" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Is there a risk of bias and confounding?</h5>
<p>Some study designs are better than others (at least <em>in theory</em>) because of their ability to address potential bias when conducted properly. As discussed in <strong><a href="science">Chapter 2</a></strong>, the goal of scientific research is inference, and some error and uncertainty is always inherent. Consumers (and producers) of research must accept this fact, and they must be willing to assess the extent to which a study’s design and methods might introduce errors that lead away from the “truth.”</p>
<p>Error can be either random or systematic. <strong>Random error</strong> adds noise (i.e., variability) to the data, but it does not affect the average. To revisit our previous example, I might step on a scale and see that I weigh 185.12. I step off and back on, and this time I weigh 185.13.<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> This is my hypothetical example so I get to weigh whatever I want.</span> This random error results from the limitations of my scale. If I continue taking measurements, this random error will balance out. Random means that the readings are not systematically too high or too low.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic error</strong> is not random. Systematic error is also known as <strong>bias</strong>, and it represents a deviation from the “truth.” Let’s imagine that my scale is broken and I do not really weigh 185. I weigh 200. I can worry about the imprecise measurements of 185.12 and 185.13 all day, but I’d be missing the bigger problem that my scale is systematically reading the wrong weight. I can keep taking measurements over and over, but my scale is just wrong. If my goal is 186, I would come to the wrong conclusion that I can stop dieting!</p>
<div class="rmdplay">

</div>
<p>Random error can be estimated, but typically, the extent to which bias affects the study results remains unknown. For this reason, this problem is often framed as a “risk of bias.”</p>
<p>In a nonrandomized design, the biggest risk of bias comes from potential <strong>selection bias</strong> <span class="citation">(Higgins and Green <a href="references.html#ref-cochrane">2011</a>)</span>. Selection bias can take different forms. In the context of intervention research, selection bias represents pretreatment (i.e., baseline) differences between study groups.</p>
<div class="rmdcomment">
<p>
Webster et al. <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-webster:2003">2003</a>)</span></span> conducted a case-control study with a non-randomized (or observational) study design in Eastern Afghanistan to study the efficacy of bed nets as a tool for preventing malaria. Patients who presented at the study clinic with a fever were tested for malaria. Those who tested positive were classified as “cases,” and the rest were classified as “controls.” The researchers asked cases and controls about their bed-net use, education, income, and several other characteristics. They then compared bed-net users and nonusers on their odds of malaria (i.e., being classified as cases).
</p>
<p>
Webster et al. <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-webster:2003">2003</a>)</span></span> wanted to look at potential selection effects with this particular research design, so they also examined patients’ use of chloroquine prior to attending the clinic. If a patient was classified as a control (negative blood film) but tested positive for chloroquine, the patient had received treatment for malaria prior to arriving at the clinic, meaning they really should have been classified as a case.
</p>
<p>
To determine whether this misclassification of cases as controls could introduce selection bias, these researchers investigated chloroquine use in bed-net users and nonusers. They found that the use of chloroquine prior to clinic testing was less common among patients who reported using bed nets than among nonusers. If chloroquine use was less common among bed-net users, the estimated effect of bed nets would have been underestimated. Consider the following example.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/selectionbias.png" />
</p>
<p>
Panels A and B show cases (those who tested positive for malaria) and controls by their reported bed-net usage. In Panel A, 4 patients were misclassified as controls, meaning that they tested negative for malaria but only because they treated themselves with chloroquine prior to the test. The panel also shows that chloroquine use is less common among net users.
</p>
<p>
Still in Panel A, the odds of malaria (cases) among bed-net users is 12/18, and the odds of malaria among nonusers is 12/6. This is an odds ratio of 0.34, suggesting that bed nets protect against malaria (cf. a value of 1 would indicate no effect).
</p>
<p>
However, Panel B shows that this effect might be an underestimate. If the misclassified control patients are moved to the case group where they belong, the odds change. Now the odds of malaria among bed-net users is 13/17 and the odds among nonusers is 15/3. This is an odds ratio of 0.15, which suggests an even greater protective effect of bed nets.
</p>
<p>
In Panel A, the effect was biased toward the null, meaning that the effect looked smaller than it probably is. This bias results in <strong>confounding</strong>, and chloroquine use is a <strong>confounding variable</strong>. Confounding variables are correlated with both the “treatment” (i.e., bed-net use) and the outcome (i.e., malaria).
</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdshiny">
<p>
Exploring selection bias
</p>
</div>
<p>An experimental design typically overcomes the risk of bias and confounding through random assignment. If the sample size is large enough, potential confounding variables like chloroquine use from the example above should be equally likely for all groups.</p>
<p>The key word here is “typically.” Many aspects of an experimental design can result in a risk of bias. For this reason, every Cochrane systematic review assesses several types of known risks of bias in RCTs <span class="citation">(Higgins and Green <a href="references.html#ref-cochrane">2011</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection bias</li>
<li>Performance bias</li>
<li>Detection bias</li>
<li>Attrition bias</li>
<li>Reporting bias</li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway at this point should be that every study has a potential for bias and, research consumers should assess the risks of bias that might challenge the validity of the reported results. This type of validity—asking, “are the study results ‘correct’?”—is typically referred to as <strong>internal validity</strong> <span class="citation">(Higgins and Green <a href="references.html#ref-cochrane">2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="who-or-what-was-the-subject-of-study-and-how-were-these-subjects-recruited-andor-selected" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Who (or what) was the subject of study and how were these subjects recruited and/or selected?</h4>
<p>Typically, a subsection of the <em>Methods</em> section describes participant recruitment and selection. What made someone eligible or ineligible to participate? Who was excluded, intentionally or not? Exclusion and inclusion criteria define the population of interest and inform the study’s <em>generalizability</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how were participants invited or selected? Was this process random, or did the researchers invite participants based on availability? The methods of sampling and selection have implications for the inferences that are possible regarding the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-materials-andor-measures-were-used-in-the-course-of-the-study" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>What materials and/or measures were used in the course of the study?</h4>
<p>Almost every study uses some type of materials or measures. Diagnostic studies, for instance, evaluate a diagnostic test or a piece of hardware that analyzes the test samples. Environmental studies often use sophisticated instruments to take atmospheric measurements. Studies like these provide specific details in the Methods section about the materials and equipment used.</p>
<p>Study variables also need to be precisely defined. For instance, hyperparasitemia describes a condition of many malaria parasites in the blood. But what constitutes “many”? The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as “a parasite density &gt; 4% (~200,000/µL)” <span class="citation">(WHO <a href="references.html#ref-whomalaria:2015">2015</a>)</span>. A manuscript should be precise with respect to how measurement is operationalized.</p>
<p>This holds for studies measuring social or psychological constructs. For instance, in a study of anxiety, a definition of the concept of “anxiety” should be provided. Is an anxiety disorder diagnosed by a psychiatrist? If so, what is the basis for this diagnosis? Or is anxiety inferred from a participant’s self-reported symptoms on a checklist or screening instrument? If so, what are the questions and how is the instrument scored?</p>
</div>
<div id="how-was-the-study-conducted-and-how-were-the-data-collected" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>How was the study conducted and how were the data collected?</h4>
<p>The data collection part of a <em>Methods</em> section should describe what happened after participants were recruited and enrolled. What happened first, second, third? Who collected the data, and how were they trained? For intervention studies, the data collection procedures should describe how participants were randomized to study arms and what happened (or did not happen) in each arm. Were the participants, data collectors, and/or patients <strong>blind</strong> to the treatment assignment?</p>
</div>
<div id="how-was-the-data-analyzed" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>How was the data analyzed?</h4>
<p>If the study uses a hypothesis-testing framework (and not all do), then details about the study hypotheses are located in the <em>Introduction</em> or <em>Methods</em> section, depending on the journal. The <em>Methods</em> section should also detail how the analysis were carried out. For example, in an intervention study, how was the effect size estimated? Did the study use ordinary least squares regression or logistic regression? The list goes on and on.</p>
<div class="rmdtip">
<p>
When preparing a manuscript, variables should be defined and analyses specified in the <em>Methods</em> section . In the <em>Results</em> section, data and findings are reported without a restatement of the methods or analysis approaches.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="was-the-study-pre-registered-and-approved-by-an-ethics-board" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Was the study pre-registered and approved by an ethics board?</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html">US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects</a> (i.e., the “Common Rule”) defines research as “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge…” If the research involves human subjects, it must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) before any subjects can be enrolled. Most studies fall under IRB oversight, but some, such as retrospective studies or quality control interventions, may qualify as exempt.</p>
<p>Increasingly, researchers are taking the additional step of registering their study protocol prior to the study launch in a study clearinghouse like <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>. This registration is a requirement for drug investigations regulated by the FDA, and it is expected by many journals.<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> From the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/publishing-and-editorial-issues/clinical-trial-registration.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a>: “Briefly, the ICMJE requires, and recommends that all medical journal editors require, registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry at or before the time of first patient enrollment as a condition of consideration for publication.”</span> Preregistration does not ensure trustworthy results, but the practice fosters a <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis">welcome increase in research transparency</a>. If the analysis described in an article deviates from the planned analysis, the authors are expected to provide a compelling justification.</p>
<div class="rmdpuzzle">
<p>
Studies often measure a number of outcomes, sometimes in a number of different ways, and it can be tempting to consider only certain results that are most applicable to the topic under investigation. . Sometimes researchers deviate from the pre-registered protocol and present different results when the pre-registered plan does not work out. This is called <strong>outcome switching</strong>, and some medical journals <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/25/11113420/outcomes-switching-medicine-compare-project">do not seem to care</a>, but the <a href="http://compare-trials.org/">COMPare Trials Project</a> thinks they should consider this diversion from the norms of scientific research reporting methods more seriously.

<h4>Can each finding be linked to data and procedures presented in the Methods?</h4>
<p>Every finding in the <em>Results</em> section should be linked to a methodology and source of data documented in the <em>Methods</em> section. Articles in medical journals are some of the shortest, so supplemental materials posted online may be needed to obtain a clearer sense of what the authors did and found.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-the-analysis-correct" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Is the analysis correct?</h4>
<p>Without access to the data and any analysis code, which is still the norm for most publications, results cannot be independently verified. Even with such access, however, some analyses are so complex that only people with extensive training feel qualified to question the accuracy of the results. When reviewing a study with complex analyses, it may be necessary to consult with colleagues.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> DISCUSSION SECTION</h3>
<div id="is-each-claim-linked-to-a-finding-presented-in-the-results" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Is each claim linked to a finding presented in the Results?</h4>
<p>Each claim should be supported by results that are reported in the paper. If there is no link between a claim in the <em>Discussion</em> section and a finding in the <em>Results</em> section, the author may be “going beyond the data.” For example, if a manuscript presents data on the efficacy of a new treatment for malaria but does not include any data on cost, then it would be inappropriate to claim that the treatment is <em>cost</em>-effective. Although it is legitimate to speculate a bit in the <em>Discussion</em> section based on documented findings, authors should be careful to label all speculation as such—and these hypothetical forays should never be included the article’s <em>Abstract</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-each-claim-justified" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Is each claim justified?</h4>
<p>Reviewers must then consider each claim in relation to the results presented to evaluate whether the authors’ arrived at the correct interpretation of the data presented. Did the authors come to a reasonable conclusion, or did they “go beyond the data” by making conclusions that are not supported by the analysis. For instance, if only weak or mixed evidence that a new program works has been provided, are the authors recommending a massive scale-up of the program? Do the authors claim that a program is cost-effective without presenting data on actual costs?</p>
</div>
<div id="are-the-claims-generalizable" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Are the claims generalizable?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Most [studies] are highly localized and paticularistic…Yet readers of [your study’s] results are rarely concerned with what happened in that particular, past, local study. Rather, they usually aim to learn either about theoretical constructs of interest or about a larger policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s Shadish et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-scc">2003</a>)</span> writing about the importance of <strong>generalizability</strong> of research findings and claims. When a study is so highly localized that the results are unlikely to generalize to new people and places, we’d say that the study has low <strong>external validity</strong>.</p>
<p>One approach to promoting generalizability is to randomly sample participants from the population of interest. For example, Wanzira et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wanzira:2016">2016</a>)</span> analyzed data from the 2014 Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey, a large national survey, and found that women who knew that sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is a medication used to prevent malaria during pregnancy had greater odds of taking at least two doses than women who did not have this knowledge. Because the UMIS is nationally representative, the results could apply to Ugandan women who did not participate in the study. Would the results be generalizable to women in Tanzania? An argument could be made that they would. Would the results be generalizable to women in France? No, probably not; among other things, malaria is not an issue there.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-the-claims-put-in-context" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Are the claims put in context?</h4>
<p>A good <em>Discussion</em> section puts the study findings in context by suggesting how the study adds to the existing literature. Do the results replicate or support other work? Or do the findings run contrary to other published studies?</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-limitations" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>What are the limitations?</h4>
<p>No study is perfect, and almost all studies include a paragraph or two outlining the shortcomings recognized by the authors. Indeed, many journals require it. Such limitations span all aspects of the study design and methods, from sample size to generalizability of results, to data validity and approaches to statistical analysis. In addition to knowing how the results fit into the bigger research landscape, communicating shortcomings can provide a valuable resource for future researchers in terms of caveats and research directions.</p>
